  <h1>Hogie's Software Projects</h1>
  <p>
    This site provides basic information about independent software projects developed by 
    Mike Hogan (Hogie). These projects include experimental tools, mobile integrations, and 
    applications for wearable devices.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Applications associated with this site do not collect or store any personally identifiable
    information. Any data used by an application—such as device settings, GPS coordinates, or 
    user-selected options—is processed on the device itself or transmitted only as necessary 
    to support the application's core functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    No personal profile information, contact information, or health data is collected, stored,
    sold, or shared. If external servers are used for optional features, only the minimum
    required technical data is transmitted (for example, an anonymous device identifier or 
    coordinate values).
  </p>

  <p>
    This policy may be updated as projects evolve or new features are added.
